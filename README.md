Getting and Cleaning Data

## Course Project
README.md: explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
submission for this course includes: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that 
were performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

## Associated Repository Files
1. CodeBook.md: Contains variable descriptions, the data, and transformations and work that was performed 
to clean up the data.
2. run_analysis.R: Contains the code that will produce the tidy data set required for the course project

## Assignment
### Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
